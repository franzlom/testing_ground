## Gamblers Ruin
A Very interesting probability problem, Gamblers Ruin
found [here](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~fewster/325/notes/ch1.pdf) from UoA
for the course *Stats 325*

I wanted to see if there probabilty to lose is realy 70% as the paper says so 
I wrote a script and you know what it does
